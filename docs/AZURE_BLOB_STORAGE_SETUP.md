### 🚀 Ready to Use

The service is already configured and uses your existing environment variable:

```env

```

### 🎯 Quick Usage Examples

#### In Any Service:

```typescript
import { AzureBlobStorageService } from 'src/shared/infrastructure/azure-storage';

@Injectable()
export class YourService {
  constructor(
    private readonly azureBlobStorageService: AzureBlobStorageService,
  ) {}

  async saveFile(data: string) {
    return await this.azureBlobStorageService.uploadBlob({
      containerName: 'documents',
      blobName: 'my-file.txt',
      data,
      contentType: 'text/plain',
    });
  }
}
```

#### REST API Endpoints Available:

- `POST /azure-storage/upload` - Upload files
- `GET /azure-storage/download/:container/:blob` - Download files
- `DELETE /azure-storage/:container/:blob` - Delete files
- `GET /azure-storage/list/:container` - List files
- `POST /azure-storage/container/:name` - Create container
