 * - Complex validation that involves external entity dependencies
 * - Business rules that span multiple bounded contexts

   * Transaction is a simple entity with basic properties (code, name, description, active)
   * and no cross-aggregate dependencies. Unlike Product or Rail domain services which
   * manage complex relationships and external dependencies, Transaction domain service
   * focuses on orchestration without complex validation:
   *
   * 1. Entity Creation: Simple aggregate creation with basic validation
   * 2. Update Coordination: Direct delegation to aggregate methods
   * 3. Deletion Orchestration: Simple delegation to aggregate deletion
   *
   * Complex business rules are handled by the aggregate itself via validateState().
   * This follows DDD principles - domain services only when business logic spans aggregates.
